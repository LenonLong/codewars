Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

So friendship is twice as strong as love :-)

Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.

The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.
